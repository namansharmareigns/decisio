# Decisio


## Project Overview
Decisio is a web-based decision intelligence platform designed to help software teams capture, track, and continuously re-evaluate critical engineering decisions throughout the software lifecycle. The platform focuses on preserving the context, assumptions, and rationale behind decisions such as architecture choices, technology selection, and development processes, and identifying when those decisions may no longer align with current project realities.

## Problem It Solves

In software projects, many critical engineering decisions are made early based on assumptions about team size, system scale, timelines, and constraints. As projects evolve, these assumptions often change, but the decisions themselves are rarely revisited. Over time, teams forget why certain choices were made and continue to operate under outdated decisions, leading to architectural mismatches, increased maintenance effort, and costly rework.

Existing tools such as documentation systems, issue trackers, and project management platforms focus on tracking tasks and code changes, but they do not provide structured support for managing the lifecycle of engineering decisions or evaluating their continued validity.

## Target Users (Personas)

### Engineering Lead
- Responsible for making architectural and technical decisions
- Needs to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability
- Wants to understand when past decisions need to be reviewed

### Project Manager
- Oversees timelines, scope, and resource allocation
- Needs visibility into risks caused by outdated decisions
- Uses insights from Decisio to support planning and reviews

## Vision Statement

The vision of Decisio is to make engineering decisions visible, explainable, and continuously relevant. By treating decisions as living entities rather than static documentation, Decisio aims to help software teams reduce long-term risk, improve decision accountability, and build systems that evolve more reliably over time.

## Key Features / Goals

- Capture and manage critical engineering decisions
- Record decision context, assumptions, and confidence levels
- Maintain and update current project context over time
- Detect decision drift when assumptions no longer hold
- Evaluate risk levels associated with outdated decisions
- Provide clear and explainable recommendations for review
## Success Metrics

- Users are able to record and retrieve engineering decisions successfully
- Decision drift is correctly identified when project context changes
- At-risk decisions are clearly highlighted and understandable
- Users can proactively review decisions before major failures occur
- The system meets all defined functional requirements

## Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users are willing to document key engineering decisions
- Project context information is updated accurately by users
- Users have basic knowledge of software engineering concepts
- Internet connectivity is available for web access

### Constraints
- The system is developed within an academic timeline
- Only open-source or free tools are used
- Decision analysis is limited to decision-level data, not source code
- AI-generated insights must remain explainable and reviewable
